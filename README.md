# ZX81-Composite-Video-Mod
Here is my design of the ZX81 composite video mod

In this entry you will find 


Eagle PCB files should you want to modify the circuit in any way

Gerber files which JLPCB will accept

Images of the PCB's and schematic

Parts List

An excell spreadsheet which contains a partslist of the components needed, as well as order codes and prices for Rapidonline.com

I couldn't get a reasonably priced 820pF Ceramic Disc capacitor from Rapid so I placed two capacitors in parallell (C3 and C5) and I suggest you solder a 
470pF and a 330pF in the space for them on the PCB. Alternaatively; if you do get an 820pF Capacitor just solder it into the C3 position.

As the minimum order for a PCB from JLPCB is 5, the order from Rapidonline.com has enough components to populate 5 circuit boards.
